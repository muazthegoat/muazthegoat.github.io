            <p>Hello fantasy owners, it's week 3 and you’re either off to a great start this season or stinking up the place, finding yourselves in a must win situation to stay afloat in your division’s standings.
              Regardless of the situation you've found yourself in I am here to guide you to a week 3 victory!</p>
            
            <p>Obvious starters like Aaron Rodgers or Antonio Brown will not be mentioned.</p>
            
            <h3>Start em sit em Quarterbacks</h3>
            
            <h5>Start em</h5>
            <h6>Matthew Stafford</h6>
            
            <p>6 Passing Touchdowns so far this season, the highest paid Qb in football looks to continue his 2017 campaign against Atlanta who will be without last years league leader in sacks, Vic Beasley. (15.5 sacks last year)
Atlanta is one of the best offenses in the league and Detroit will be forced to keep up, which means lots of passing for Stafford. This has the potential to be a shootout, start Stafford with confidence in Week 3.</p>
            
            <h6>Derek Carr</h6>
            
            <p>Already the #6 Quarterback in fantasy through 2 weeks of play, if you drafted him you're satisfied with his recent results. Expect another solid week from the second round standout from Fresno State against the Redskins, who gave up a big game to Carson Wentz in week 2.</p>
            
            <h5>Sit em</h5>
            <h6>Russell Wilson</h6>
            
            <p>Once a consistent top 5 fantasy Qb, Wilson has failed to throw for 200 yards in a game through the season’s first 2 weeks. This is in large part due to Seattle’s offensive line being a mess. I wouldn't put him in my lineup until their offense gets figured out regardless of the matchup.</p>
            
            
<!--             <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
 -->
            <h6>Jameis Winston</h6>
            
            <p>The 3rd year signal caller will be going up against a very stout Vikings defense in week 3. With the Buccaneers still waiting on Doug Martin and his suspension along with Minnesota's shutdown corner Xavier Rhodes who’s looking to limit Mike Evans, Winston’s outlook is limited. Minnesota held Drew Brees to 1 touchdown and only 15 fantasy point in week 2. Winston isn't a top 10 option at the position for week 3.</p>
            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
